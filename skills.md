#### Analysis & Problem Polving

I'm an analytical thinker,

I like breaking problems down, and solving them with code

problem solving
creative thinking
push myself and putting in situation where I'm not entirely comfortable -->
pushing the boundaries is how we grow

I am a problem solver at heart and I love a challenge

Climbing, rubiks cubes etc.



#### Clean Code & Attention to Detail


organized so that i can work efficient lt both physically and in my code
--> lead on to clean code principles?
logical thinking to reach a goal
make sure things are organised so that i have space to see a solution
organise things logically so i have different options ways of doing things



Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Exercising programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production.

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.

Throughout my time at Makers Academy I learned about the merits of having a readable codebase, as well as the potential pitfalls which can happen if a codebase is not readable. During the course, programming principles such as SOLID & DRY, as well as exposure to XP values in group situtations were all utilised to ensure best practice. TDD is a huge driver in keeping code efficient, clean & as bug-free as possible - I am a huge fan of this approach to developing software.

My role in the shop has made me keenly aware of the importance of giving quality service.
I have had to be well organised to carry out my duties of replenishing stock, handling cash and delivering efficient service to customers.

I have trained many new staff, and have recently taken on further managerial tasks such as setting the rota.

Good communication and customer service have been essential to my role when advising customers, particularly during busy times.
the need to remain calm during busy times and under pressure. My level-headed manner has helped me with various groups of energetic children
with a confident and friendly manner.
