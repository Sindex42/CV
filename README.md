I am a full-stack junior software engineer, recent Makers Academy graduate and am looking to improve my skills and grow as a developer.

I worked in customer facing roles in the climbing industry for 3 years as a rock climbing instructor and shop assistant. This is where I built my problem solving and logical thinking skills which are reflected in my programming projects. I focus on code that is clean, efficient and easy to maintain.

## Projects

[Gilded Rose](https://github.com/Sindex42/gilded-rose-js) | Refactoring exercise, practice at handling legacy code | 3-4 days | JavaScript, NodeJS, Jest
[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Sindex42/bank-tech-test) | Javascript banking app interacted with through the browser console | 3-4 days | JavaScript, Jasmine
[Orthogonal Quest](https://github.com/Sindex42/orthogonal-quest) | Makers Academy final group project, top down adventure game | 2 weeks | Python3, PyGame, TravisCI, Code Climate, Pylint, AutoPep8


## Skills

#### Communication & Adaptability

During my time as a climbing instructor, I used my knowledge and enthusiasm for climbing to advise and encourage clients of varying ages and abilities. I delivered clear and accurate instructions and adapted them to each individual group. This required a good understanding of the customers' needs, while making sure that my information was comprehensive, and keeping the health and safety issues involved in mind.

#### Attention to Detail

During my group project where we built a Facebook clone, we set up continuous integration with Travis CI but couldn't get our linter checks to pass. Initially, we came up with a workaround but we weren't satisfied with just disabling some of the linter rules. After some research, I discovered that some of offending comments were being automatically generated as part of the database migration. We then added the offending schema file to the list of ignored files and this allowed us to continue on with peace of mind knowing we'd tackled the problem correctly.

## Interests
- Rock climbing: From trad climbing in Yosemite and the Peak District, to bouldering in Fontainebleau, I have been a keen climber since 2011, travelling and climbing around the world.
- Puzzles: My modest collection of Rubik's cubes and burr puzzles is slowly overtaking all available shelf space.
- Languages: Growing up in Luxembourg, I am fluent in French, German, and Luxembourgish.
